# Dennis Broekhuizen TriviaFlop

[![BCH compliance](https://bettercodehub.com/edge/badge/DennisBroekhuizen/DennisBroekhuizen-TriviaFlop?branch=master)](https://bettercodehub.com/)

Created my own iOS quiz app in Swift. Made use of opentdb.com API to retrieve multiple choice questions in the category sports. The user is required to create an account to play the game and to submit their score to the leaderboard. To have an unique apearance in the leaderboard the user is asked to add an username while registering. The app checks if the username is unique by comparing it to existing usernames in the database.

App submitted for Minor Programmeren University of Amsterdam.
